1. Reason 1 is that it's less resource-intense to use pointers because we avoid unessecary copying as we transfer the vector between functions
   Reason 2 is that because the posts are dynamically allocated, the objects will exist in memory even when they leave the current scope, and we'll be able to access them later.

2. The message field is a private instance variable in the Post class; InstancePost cannot access private variables in its parent class directly.

3. The 'virtual' keyword makes this type of behavior (polymorphism) possible, and it's included at the beginning of the function signature in the parent class.

4. I spent I spent around 7-8 hours on this assignment.
